TLE: Friendship (Sean Zhu)

This game is about two heroines on an adventure together fighting baddies and whatnot while they wait for the advent. Everyone
struggles to find happiness in this world but at least these gals have each other, right? Maybe one day more people will want to
be their friends. We can only hope.
The game uses Unity

CONTROLS:

ABOUT THE GAME:
This game is inspired by a mix of endless runner games and Crusaders Quest, a game revolving around matching blocks to beat
levels. The goal is to survive to the very end while using your characters to attack enemies via matching blocks and keyboard
controls. Although using blocks can activate powerful skills, there are some conditions to be aware of. Only 3 chains will
activate skills (although some skills may modify this condition). Matching blocks that are < 3 will not only prevent the skill
from activating, but it will also deplete mana depending on the skill cost (removal of only 1 block will deplete 2x the mana cost
and removal of 2 blocks will deplete 1x the mana cost).

Collect points by defeating enemies, which can be spent on upgrades between games.

Skill upgrades are available to purchase and equip between games. Skill variants remain locked until the original skill has
been upgraded 5 times. Once unlocked, these skill variants can be equipped.

Music and sound have not been added intentionally (available on the next update or whatever). There is no need to turn up the
volume.

The story of this game has been mostly omitted, as it is still being worked on. The lore of this game and the character designs
were conceived before the announcement of the GMD, however the theme, game mechanics, and art have all been made during the
GMD period. Further work will be done on polishing this game as a prequel for a larger game some time (possibly years)
in the future.

Stay tuned!
